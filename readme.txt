Esch: Embedded Scheme
======================

Introduction
--------------

`Embedded SCHeme` tries to provide an R6RS_ compilant Scheme language
interpreter. It tries provide two products:

* A library, ``libesch.a``. This is a library to provide core features
  of Scheme interpretation and core library.
* An executable interpreter, ``esch``. This is the interpreter and
  debugger to execute given Scheme script.

Esch is implemented in so called Clean C89, which means it should be
able to be ported to different operating systems.

Build Esch
------------

Esch uses SCons_ as build system. It allows Esch to be built cross
platforms.
